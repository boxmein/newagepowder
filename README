  Literally The Powder Toy only with a very old version. 


Building
--------

  Linux
  ~~~~~

    You'll need these packages:
    * libsdl1.2-dev (or 1.n, but not 2.n) 
    * libbz2-dev

    If you're on any system with the APT package manager you can get the 
    packages with this command: 
    % make deps
    ... which expands to 
    % sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libbz2-dev

    For other package managers, I'll leave finding out the package names 
    (which very often overlap but not always) as an exercise to the reader.

  Windows
  ~~~~~~~

    It's easier if you get MinGW (select the base, msys and C++ packages).


    (Note: chances are your %PATH% won't be updated after the install until
     the next restart so if you're impatient you can use the following: 
     `set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin` command in order to put the MinGW binary
     directory into the search path temporarily)

    You'll have to acquire the same packages: 
    You can get bzip2 within mingw-get
    > mingw-get install mingw32-libbz2 bzip2

    ...but SDL is a trickier business: you'll have to install it yourself.
    http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz

    You will have to copy this into C:\MinGW\include\ so that it will all be 
    in its own separate SDL directory: C:\MinGW\include\SDL\SDL.h for example. 

    Also it'll include libSDL.a and libSDLmain.a which must be copied into
    C:\MinGW\lib. 

    After all those it should compile cleanly. Running however requires SDL.dll
    which can be acquired here:
    http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15-win32.zip
    http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15-win32-x64.zip (64-bit) 

    The two can either be placed to any directory on the PATH or into the repo's
    directory itself.

  OSX
  ~~~

    ....Well we don't really know.

    This guide might help you. Note that you will NOT need Lua, FFTW et al
    to compile. All you'll need is SDL and libbz2.

Font editor???
--------------

  The font editor has been relocated to 
  https://github.com/boxmein/tpt-font-editor . 
  The font.h produced is compatible, yet the program itself is far more
  reasonable to use. Make sure to unpack the current font.h before editing.
