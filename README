  Literally The Powder Toy only with a very old version. 


Building
--------

  Linux
  ~~~~~

    http://powdertoy.co.uk/Wiki/W/Compiling_for_Linux.html

    You'll need these packages:
    * libsdl1.2-dev (or 1.n, but not 2.n) 
    * libbz2-dev

    If you're on any system with the APT package manager you can get the 
    packages with this command: 
    % make deps
    ... which expands to 
    % sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libbz2-dev

    For other package managers, I'll leave finding out the package names 
    (which very often overlap but not always) as an exercise to the reader.

  Windows
  ~~~~~~~

    It's easier if you get MinGW (select the base, msys and C++ packages).

    (Note: chances are your %PATH% won't be updated after the install until
     the next restart so if you're impatient you can use the following: 
     `set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin` command in order to put the MinGW binary
     directory into the search path temporarily)

    You'll have to acquire the same packages: 
    You can get bzip2 within mingw-get
    > mingw-get install mingw32-libbz2 bzip2

    ...but SDL is a trickier business: you'll have to install it yourself.
    http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz

    You will have to copy this into C:\MinGW\include\ so that it will all be 
    in its own separate SDL directory: C:\MinGW\include\SDL\SDL.h for example. 

    Also it'll include libSDL.a and libSDLmain.a which must be copied into
    C:\MinGW\lib. 

    After all those it should compile cleanly. Running however requires SDL.dll
    which can be acquired here:
    http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15-win32.zip
    http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15-win32-x64.zip (64-bit) 

    The two can either be placed to any directory on the PATH or into the repo's
    directory itself.

    -----------------

    For Visual Studio (later VS), there's a tutorial for newer TPT versions 
    which will apply quite a lot to the project at hand: 

    Prerequisites: 
    
    * SDL for Visual Studio http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-VC.zip
      Extract this into the source code folder under include\, so that there'd be
      "newagepowder\include\SDL\SDL.h".
      Alternatively extract this into 
      "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include", where
      10.0 is your correct Visual Studio version and so that there'll be a SDL 
      subfolder inside. This will make it available for future projects with 
      Visual Studio.
      
    * libbz2.lib + headers for Visual Studio 

    Process:

    1. Open Visual Studio, select 
       File -> New -> New Project from Existing Code...
       and from there select your TPT source folder.
       The project type should be "Windows application project" or similar. 
       Nothing else should be required - press Finish in the wizard.

    2. Keep the "Solution" selected in the Solution Explorer window, then select
       Build -> Configuration Manager. Under the "Active Solution Configuration", 
       select Release. We'll configure this first, you can set up Debug similarly
       later. Note that Debug attaches VS debug libraries which bog up the code.
       It'll be much more useful in debugging via VS though. Close the dialog
       box via OK.

    3. Select Project -> Properties... 
       Under Configuration Properties -> General: 
       1. Change the Output Directory optionally to: $(SolutionDir)Build\
       2. Change the Target Name to whatever you want, optionally use 
          $(Configuration) in the name to differentiate between Debug and 
          Release builds.
       Under Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories:
       1. Edit Include Directories to include $(ProjectDir)include\ (if you 
          extracted SDL into here)
       2. 

  OSX
  ~~~

    ....Well we don't really know.
    http://powdertoy.co.uk/Wiki/W/Compiling_for_Mac_OS_X.html
    This guide might help you. Note that you will NOT need Lua, FFTW et al
    to compile. All you'll need is SDL and libbz2.

Font editor???
--------------

  The font editor has been relocated to 
  https://github.com/boxmein/tpt-font-editor . 
  The font.h produced is compatible, yet the program itself is far more
  reasonable to use. Make sure to unpack the current font.h before editing.
