  Literally The Powder Toy only with a very old version. 


Font editor???
--------------

  The font editor has been relocated relocated to 
  https://github.com/boxmein/tpt-font-editor . 
  The font.h produced is compatible, yet the program itself is far more
  reasonable to use. Make sure to unpack the current font.h before editing.
